				<![CDATA[
<p>Constantly being hacked could be a sign of flattery from people who really want your business.</p>



<p>Payal Kadakia, founder of&nbsp;<a href="https://classpass.com/">ClassPass</a>, was smart enough to realize this and change her business model accordingly.</p>



<p>Kadakia didn’t know it at the time, but all of her life experiences were leading her to form a wildly successful start up bringing discounted classes to the people and business to fitness studios. She graduated from MIT in 2005 and much to her parents dismay did not pursue a higher math education but instead in 2009 founded an Indian-themed dance company called Sa, drawing from her years of dance growing up. While her dance company found success performing around New York City, Kadakia felt an entrepreneurial calling to do something more.<br></p>



<p>CLASSPASS&#8217;S HISTORY</p>



<p>One evening, she wanted to take a drop in dance class in New York City, but found there was no platform to find readily available options in one place. Kadakia took it upon herself to create that platform and in 2011 founded Classtivity. But fewer than 100 fitness classes were booked on Classtivity during the company’s first year, and customer retention rates were low.</p>



<p>To add to the struggle, Kadakia was mugged and maced while working on Classtivity in a Starbucks in 2012, just weeks before a venture capitalist meeting in San Francisco. Her laptop and phone were stolen, which Kadakia interpreted as a sign to perfect and strengthen her business.</p>



<p>2013 heralded in plan B. Many customers were repeatedly trying to use their $49 new customer promotion so they could test out a lot of new studios, not a the same ones over and over. This meant it was door to door sales time for Kadakia and co-founder Mary Biggins, pitching to more studios their vague new restructuring of ClassPass.<br></p>



<p>ClassPass&#8217;s Success</p>



<p>Customers wanted to test out a lot of studios, not take the same classes repeatedly. After participating in the Techstars accelerator in 2012, Classtivity was officially rebranded as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/ClassPass/">@ClassPass</a>&nbsp;in 2014, a monthly gym-like membership for people who wanted to get in shape with a different workout every time. For roughly $45-$160 a month depending on the city, subscribers can decide between hundreds of local classes such as cycling, yoga, boot camp, swimming, boxing and more. Users can only register for the same venue 3 times a month so ClassPass doesn’t cannibalize its partners’ loyal customers and pricing.</p>



<p>Over 50 million classes have been booked through the platform since its launch in 2013.&nbsp;<strong>ClassPass</strong>&nbsp;is located in 50 cities around the world and has raised a total of $173 million from investors, bringing its valuation to $470 million. Kadakia herself boasted a net worth of at least $50 million in 2016, landing her spots on both Forbes’ Women Entrepreneurs to Watch list and Fortune’s 40 under 40.</p>



<p>After leading the company for 4 years, Kadakia stepped down as ClassPass CEO in March 2017. She currently serves as executive chairman of the company, stating that she feels happier and more effective in a creative role, despite those saying she should remain CEO simply because a woman should be CEO if she can.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>A “broquet” to end all bouquets…</p>



<p><a href="https://manlymanco.com/">The Manly Man Company sells</a>&nbsp;hand crafted beef jerky floral bouquets that “are 100% edible and truly are made for that rugged one of a kind, hammer swinging, IPA drinking, duck hunting, beast of a man-animal you call yours.”</p>



<p>The idea for the Manly Man Co. came to Greg Murray after gifting his wife flowers and wondering why there wasn’t a male equivalent. It seemed to him showering women with gifts had many traditional options, but men had virtually no symbols of affection during courtship.<br></p>



<p>MANLY MAN&#8217;S BEGINNINGS</p>



<p>Murray and his wife agreed that beef jerky was a great solution, and even more romantic was flowers made out of beef jerky. Not long after their conversation, Greg’s wife crafted Greg a “Man Bouquet” of sticks of beef jerky with carved flowers wrapped around them, presented in a beer mug, the first broquet prototype.</p>



<p>The company has faced some backlash regarding their exclusive marketing for men; women love jerky, too. Orders began coming in requesting that the bouquet arrive not in a mug that read “Manly Man” on it because the gift was for a woman. While unexpected, Murray is all for catering to this new demographic and is launching a new, gender neutral brand to grow alongside his growing, veteran owned company.<br></p>



<p>Manly Man&#8217;s Success</p>



<p>Murray quickly went from a few employees making bouquets to a full blown operation that goes well into the night before major holidays such as Valentine’s Day, Father’s Day and Christmas. This past Valentine’s Day saw preorders for Valentine’s day as early as October and orders closed several weeks before the holiday.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/ManlyManCompany/">@ Manly Man</a>&nbsp;bouquets come in either daisy or rose variations in flavors of original, teriyaki or hot. Since each bouquet is handmade, taking about thirty minutes to craft, orders must be scheduled well in advance. The order arrives pre-arranged in a sealed and stylish box, with the option of adding a “Man Card” bottle opener or “Whisker Damn” beer mug mustache protector.</p>



<p>Sadly for the vegetarians and vegans, there are no kalequets or tofuquets in the works for this company’s product line, but Manly Man Co. is continuing to expand to a bigger location with more merchandise available for customization.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>For a change, a trend started in the midwest and made its way to the coasts, rather than the other way around.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.lacroixwater.com/">La Croix Water</a>&nbsp;(pronounced La Croy) is an American sparkling water brand that most millennials remember seeing their moms drink on beach trips or other events where a sugarless but carbonated alternative for pop was desired. Then, suddenly, the beverage brand started popping up in hipster Brooklyn bars and LA writer’s rooms and nobody could figure out why this tackily designed water was so trendy.</p>



<p>LA CROIX&#8217;S BEGINNINGS</p>



<p>The company started in 1981 in La Crosse, Wisconsin near the St. Croix River, with La Croix meaning “the cross” in French. But don’t be fooled by the fancy sounding name, La Croix is an “Anti-Perrier” brand, specifically marketing to those put off by snobby sparkling water.</p>



<p>The popularity of sparkling water went under the radar in America, as it was primarily consumed only in upscale European restaurants. Then a movement began crusading against sugary pop and other unhealthy beverages contributing to obesity and medical issues. When La Croix was sold to National Beverage in 1992, the company was worth $25M, but ready for a rebrand.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/LaCroixWater/">@La Croix’s</a>&nbsp;branding is half of what makes the drink. A design scoffed at by other design agencies and least favored by corporate won over consumer focus groups by a landslide. While other sparkling water companies take a clean and simple approach, La Croix is full of jazzy color and flowing text. A gaudy but resonating design capturing the casual sophistication the design team was hoping for.</p>



<p>La Croix&#8217;s Design</p>



<p>The design of the 12-ounce can won a Gold Global Design Award for packaging in 2003, much to the confusion and amazement of graphic design and brand marketing studios.</p>



<p>Pop consumption plummeted to a 30 year low in the US in 2015. La Croix took this opportunity to introduce Cúrate, a new line of cans and flavors specifically aimed at attracting millennials and boosting social media. The slimmer can, saturated colors and updated flavors led LaCroix to triple its sales within one year of Cúrate’s unveiling.</p>



<p>Expanding its selection from a mere 6 varieties in 2004 to 20 and counting by 2015,&nbsp;<strong>La Croix</strong>&nbsp;is the only brand that has been elevated to a lifestyle unto themselves. The seltzer brand has its own page of Etsy crafts, hundreds of thousands of followers on Instagram, an unofficial line of swimsuits, and an unofficial t-shirt line stating “La Croixs Over Boys.” All that’s missing is people naming their kids after the brand!</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>So you’ve got your business. That’s great! Coming up with an idea and getting started is often the hardest part of entrepreneurship. Whether you’re just planting your roots or moving from another location, how to determine the right location for your business is often a challenging task. It’s a big decision that affects many factors, and in many cases you have to choose what is most important to you and compromise on things you want but don’t need.</p>



<p>These are the top points to consider when picking a location for your business:</p>



<p>TAXES</p>



<p>If you’re able to choose any state you want, that’s awesome. You can pick a location that has low property and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fundkite.com/blog/tax-season/">business taxes</a>, and depending on your industry, sales and transportation taxes. While keeping the low taxes of certain states in mind, it’s important to factor in whether or not you’ll need a highly populated area to stay afloat. States like California, New York and New Jersey are known for their high taxes but have excellent environments to start companies.</p>



<p>Hiring Pool</p>



<p>The next step is to evaluate the hiring pool in the area. A rural area may have better skills for manufacturing and manual labor, while a city setting would have a better selection of tech, marketing and communications. Your location will set the work environment regardless of who you hire. If you don’t have parking, a variety of lunch options or an outdoor seating area, some potential hires may be discouraged.</p>



<p>Nearby Partnerships</p>



<p>No matter what industry you’re in, you’re going to need other businesses to do business. Some companies operate digitally and even have all remote employees, but the majority of businesses will need to buy and sell good from other vendors and will want to be in an area that has those connections. Being isolated may be cheaper but will cost more doing business in the long run. Retailers especially want to be near highly trafficked spots, however that being said…</p>



<p>Nearby Competitors</p>



<p>While you want partnerships nearby, you don’t want an area oversaturated with competitors. It is extremely important to research an area and see if you would be filling a market gap, creating your own market, or competing with multiple businesses offering the same product or service. This is especially true for a small business competing with a major chain or long-standing name. It wouldn’t be that your business is bad, just that the area wasn’t a fit.</p>



<p>Size and growth options</p>



<p>As a business owner, you know to always look ahead at the future, and that’s no different when wondering how to choose the right location for your business. If you see expansion on the horizon, are their ordinances or zoning restrictions prohibiting you from growing? Is the area robust with opportunities for multiple locations? Don’t get overleveraged, but don’t box yourself in either.</p>



<p>Buy or Lease Options</p>



<p>Do you already know if you’d want to buy or lease? Are you open to either? If you lease do you see yourself someday buying? It may seem small now, but when it’s time to seek growth funding and bank loans, having property will make it easier to get that working capital. Additionally if you decide to expand or make property changes, you could end up butting heads with the landlord. Contrarily, if all there are are options to buy, you might strain cash flow too soon.</p>



<p>Each factor is unique to each business and the size, industry and cash flow of it. You’re building your business from the ground up, quite literally, and get to decide every big decision and small detail on the way. Research research research when it comes to picking out a location for your business, and you’ll put yourself ahead of the curve from the onset!</p>



<p>For Your Business</p>

<p>When looking at the demographics of business loans for minorities, there is a noticeable gap between approval rates for non-minority business owners and minority business owners. Minority owned businesses have a harder time funding funding and getting approved for loans, the reason for which is attributed to many factors.</p>



<p>A 2010 study titled “<a href="https://www.mbda.gov/page/executive-summary-disparities-capital-access-between-minority-and-non-minority-businesses">Disparities in Capital Access between Minority and Non-Minority-Owned Businesses</a>” done by the Minority Business Development Agency determined that minority-owned firms are more likely to be denied loans. Among firms with gross receipts under $500,000, loan denial rates for minority firms were at 42% compared to those of non-minority-owned firms at 16%. For high sales firms, the rate of loan denial was almost twice as high for minority firms as for non-minority firms.</p>



<p>The study also found minority-owned firms are more likely to not apply for loans due to rejection fears. Among firms with gross receipts under $500,000, 33% of minority firms did not apply for loans because of fear of rejection compared to 17% of non-minority firms. For high sales firms, 19%of minority firms did not apply for loans because of a fear of rejection compared to 12% of non-minority firms.</p>



<p>WHAT CAUSES THIS DISPARITY?</p>



<p>Much of it comes down to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesfinancecouncil/2018/01/22/why-minorities-have-so-much-trouble-accessing-small-business-loans/#4f3b14ec55c4">bank qualifications</a>. Banks require large amounts of collateral, high credit scores and strong revenue, which can be hard to obtain depending on your socioeconomic standing. Despite small business being a vital part of the economy of diverse communities, banks do not commonly give out loans to these minority-owned businesses.</p>



<p>Minority Business Statistics</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Between 2007 and 2017 the number minority owned SMBs have grown by 79% reaching 11.1 million. This growth is about 10 times faster than the 7.6% overall growth rate for U.S. small businesses during this period.”&nbsp;<a href="https://www.smallbizlabs.com/2017/10/number-of-minority-owned-us-small-businesses-growing-rapidly.html">source</a></li>



<li>“The populations of five states, including the two largest, California and Texas, are now over 50%&nbsp;<strong>minorities</strong>. Many other states, counties, and cities are approaching this threshold, thus understanding minority business ownership is increasingly important.”&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/advocacy/Minority-Owned-Businesses-in-the-US.pdf">source</a></li>



<li>“In 2012, 8.0 million minority-owned businesses contributed $1.38 trillion in revenue and 7.2 million jobs to the economy.”&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/advocacy/Minority-Owned-Businesses-in-the-US.pdf">source</a></li>



<li>“Minority firms are less likely to be in the top 20 employment industries. Minority-owned businesses make up only 16.8% of businesses in these industries, far less than the 29% average across all industries.”&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/advocacy/Minority-Owned-Businesses-in-the-US.pdf">source</a></li>
</ul>



<p>What if minorities are rejected for a bank loan?</p>



<p>The alternative lending industry has been extremely beneficial in helping minorities get the funding they need to run and grow their businesses. While rates are typically higher than a traditional bank loan, merchants with low credit scores, seasonal cash flow, unique industries, no collateral and other former setbacks are able to get short term funding previously unavailable to them. Apply for alternative funding with FundKite where bad credit is accepted and no collateral is needed!</p>

<p>After the in-laws, gifting your boss is probably the hardest person to shop for on your list.</p>



<p>Really, what do you get someone who makes more money than you? Who knows how much you make? Who you want to thank immensely without being too much of a goody-goody?</p>



<p>It doesn’t have to be holiday gifts either. Birthdays and other special occasions ask the same question: What can I get a superior at work?</p>



<p>Much of the answer lies in thoughtful, perhaps priceless, holiday gifts.<br></p>



<p>A BOOK</p>



<p>Many bosses are too busy to sit down and read, or you might be lucky and have an avid reader as a boss who you can easily find a book for. If you don’t know what kind of book, something educational to advance their career (without insulting their current performance) is a great idea. You can mix up a book gift by getting them a book on tape for commuting, a kindle, or a magazine subscription.<br></p>



<p>Relaxation &amp; Stress Relief</p>



<p>Running a department or entire company is stressful. Everyone has different comfort levels with physical pampering, but men and women alike often enjoy the novelty of a massager attached to an office chair or a relaxation soy candle. Other stress busters include: massage gift certificate, a pampering gift set, or a unique handmade soap or candle set you picked up at a on-of-a-kind holiday market.<br></p>



<p>Alcohol</p>



<p>It doesn’t have to be a party office to know that your boss winds down with a glass of red wine every night or enjoys long weekends spent on the Kentucky Bourbon trail. A thoughtful bottle of alcohol shows that you listen when he or she talks about their weekend and niche drinking palette.<br></p>



<p>Office Decor</p>



<p>Has said boss made a comment about needing to go for a walk or spend more time outside? You can bring the nature to them with an easy to care for office plant, or one with a grow light. Other office decor ideas include artwork for the walls, desktop calendars, bookshelf display pieces, or any other thoughtful holiday gifts to keep in an office.<br></p>



<p>A Joke</p>



<p>If you can’t think of something the person would really really like, try thinking of something they would laugh at. Examples are a mug with a funny saying about bosses, a stress busting punching bag, dart board, funny calendar, or inside joke between the two of you.<br></p>



<p>Food</p>



<p>Food is great because it’s usable. It won’t be a piece of junk that was interesting at the time and then never used again, taking up space and clutter homes and offices. An indulgent specialty gift like high end cheese, truffle sauce or premium cut steaks shows you went out of your way to get a truly special gift that they can share with their family. Another popular idea is a food basket with a variety of snacks and treats.<br></p>



<p>Cigars</p>



<p>A bit specific, but a popular indulgent gift for bosses who have a specific smoking interest. This gift idea falls under the category of “usable gifts that won’t sit around for years.” Just be sure to know what style and region your boss likes, most people are particular about their brand.<br></p>



<p>Group Gift</p>



<p>Want to get your boss something nice but you both know you can’t afford it? Ask around the office to see if anyone would be willing to pool their money together to get something from several of you. Your coworkers are probably just as lost with holiday gifts for your boss as you are!</p>

<p>In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, many business owners are searching for ways to save on their expenses.&nbsp;<strong>Renegotiate Your Business Lease</strong>&nbsp;or getting a rent abatement are some options, cutting back on inventory, automating operations, or downsizing your staff, entrepreneurs across the nation are having to make some tough decisions about how to navigate through this new&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/what-will-the-stock-market-look-like-in-a-post-coronavirus-world-the-bulls-are-hoping-history-repeats-itself-2020-04-19">post-coronavirus marketplace</a>.</p>



<p>One of the best ways to save on your overhead each month is to renegotiate your business lease to see if you can come to a mutually beneficial agreement with your landlord. Though negotiating with your landlord is a task that few entrepreneurs look forward to making,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.adventuresincre.com/tenant-sales-occupancy-cost-analysis/">occupancy costs</a>&nbsp;are serious expenses that affect your bottom line every month.</p>



<p>WHY WOULD MY LANDLORD RENEGOTIATE MY LEASE?</p>



<p>Being business-minded, this is the first question on most business owners’ minds. More than likely you’re somewhere in the middle of your current lease, which means that you’re contractually obligated to pay for the rest of the lease agreement, so why would your landlord agree to take in less revenue?</p>



<p>The main reason a property owner would lower your rent is simply that they don’t want to lose you as a tenant. The housing market is just as precarious as any other industry right now and losing a reliable revenue stream, even if it’s not quite as lucrative as they want, can be a significant blow. Also, you probably have no idea what kind of financial position your landlord is in, unless you have a close relationship, so maybe they can afford to take a hit for the rest of the year knowing that your business will&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-companies-lose-hope-for-quick-rebound-from-covid-19-11595151000">rebound</a>&nbsp;in the coming months.</p>



<p>Lastly, they might be more likely to consider a renegotiation if you offer them some kind of incentive for keeping you on as a tenant. This could include deferred interest on a reduced portion of your rent or offering them a percentage of income as a way to make the renegotiation more attractive to your landlord</p>



<p>How Should I Approach My Landlord?</p>



<p>There are several ways that you could go about how to&nbsp;<strong>renegotiate your business lease</strong>&nbsp;with your landlord. If you already have a close relationship with them or you know them on a personal level, you probably want to factor this information into your approach.</p>



<p>That being said, here are our best tips for approaching your landlord about a lease renegotiation.&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Speak to them sooner rather than later</strong>&nbsp;– If your rent is due in a few days, and you’re only just now broaching the subject with your landlord, it’s probably already too late. Landlords are business owners too and they have to be able to forecast their income just like you. Don’t wait to talk to them until it’s too late.</li>



<li><strong>Talk to them in-person</strong>&nbsp;– You don’t necessarily need to set up a face-to-face meeting with your landlord, but make sure you at least speak to them on the phone when you’re renegotiating your business lease. So much gets lost in emails or texts, and your landlord is more likely to say no immediately to an email than to your face.</li>



<li><strong>Attitude is everything</strong>&nbsp;– Like most of your business interactions, your attitude when approaching this issue is everything. Don’t act like your landlord owes you a break on the rent or like you’re doing them a favor by being their tenant. Instead, speak to them entrepreneur to entrepreneur and explain the realities of your business right now. Most landlords are aware of how devastating the lockdowns were on small businesses and their tenants.</li>



<li><strong>Recommend a Solution</strong>&nbsp;– The next section will deal in more depth about the possible solutions available to you, so for now we’ll simply say, don’t approach your landlord without an idea of how you can solve this situation. Going to them and simply saying that you’d like a rent reduction is not sufficient. Have clear solutions that you both can realistically implement.</li>



<li><strong>Have a Back-Up Plan</strong>&nbsp;– What if your landlord flat-out says no? Do you have a plan to deal with that outcome? If you don’t, then you’ll find yourself at loggerheads which is the last place you want to be. Have a plan B in case your landlord disagrees with your first proposed solution and maybe even have a backup plan for that. Being a good&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescommunicationscouncil/2018/07/19/five-tips-to-become-a-more-successful-negotiator/#24b50c057961">negotiator</a>&nbsp;often involves coming back to the table again and again. Be prepared for that outcome.</li>
</ul>



<p>What Are My Options for Renegotiating My Business Lease?</p>



<p>As we mentioned above, offering your landlord an incentive for renegotiating your rent is one way to provide a solution to this problem, but the most common ways to decrease your monthly rental expenses are rent reduction, rent abatement, or partial rent abatement.</p>



<p>Let’s look at each one:</p>



<p><strong>Rent Abatement&nbsp;</strong>– This option involves your landlord agreeing to forgo your rent for a certain amount of time, say a few months, with the understanding that you’ll pay it back with interest later down the line. Think of it as a loan. Your landlord is giving you a loan to cover your rent for a certain number of months, and you will pay them back along with the agreed-upon interest when the time is over. This is a particularly good option if your revenue is low right now, but you think that it will pick up again soon.</p>



<p><strong>Partial Rent Abatement</strong>&nbsp;– A partial rent abatement is exactly what it sounds like. In this scenario, your landlord abates a portion of your monthly rent instead of the entire thing. Many business owners might feel more comfortable with this option because they don’t have to pay back such a large portion of missed rent later. Remember though, interest still accrues on a partial rent abatement, so make sure you’re factoring that into your plan</p>



<p><strong>Rent Reduction</strong>&nbsp;– This is a pretty straightforward way of curbing your rent expense. With this option, you ask your landlord for a reduction in your monthly rent whether it be permanently or for a temporary window of time. The ladder option will probably be more appealing to your landlord, but if you decide to go this route, make sure that you’re considering where your business will be in the future. If you don’t expect much to improve in terms of sales over the next year or so, then a temporary rent reduction might not help you in the long run.</p>

<p>No matter what stage your business is at, a SWOT analysis can help you strategize and develop your business plan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why? A&nbsp;<strong>SWOT</strong>&nbsp;analysis is a compilation of your company’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats.</p>



<p>It may seem like it’s a way to figure out what you already know, but if done correctly, a SWOT analysis can help you to look at your business for different perspectives. To achieve the maximum benefits from this strategizing session, gather as diverse of a group of employees as you can to help enrich the discussion. Ask people from sales, marketing, accounting, buying/product development, IT and every other department too so that all corners of your business are represented.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By listening to how each department is performing, you can discover ways leverage the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats that exist in your market.</p>



<p>BUSINESS SWOT ANALYSIS</p>



<p>The SWOT analysis is an opportunity to look not only at yourself but at your competitors as well. It can be a way to get strategy brainstorming going or a more serious strategy formation tool.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Strengths and weaknesses are often internal to your organization, while opportunities and threats generally relate to external factors. For this reason, SWOT can be used interchangeably with Internal-External Analysis.</p>



<p>Here are some questions you should ask about your business when examining the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats of your business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Strengths</p>



<p>What advantages does your organization have?</p>



<p>What business processes are successful?</p>



<p>What do you do better than anyone else?</p>



<p>What unique or lowest-cost resources can you draw upon that others can’t?</p>



<p>What advantages do you have over your competition?</p>



<p>What is your organization’s Unique Selling Proposition (USP)?</p>



<p>What assets do you have in your team, such as knowledge, education, network, skills, and reputation?</p>



<p>What physical assets do you have, such as customers, equipment, technology, cash, and patents?</p>



<p>Weaknesses</p>



<p>What could you improve?</p>



<p>What should you avoid?</p>



<p>What factors lose you sales?</p>



<p>Are your competitors doing any better than you?</p>



<p>What business processes need improvement?</p>



<p>Are there tangible assets that your company needs, such as money or equipment?</p>



<p>Are there gaps on your team?</p>



<p>Is your location ideal for your success?</p>



<p>Is your market growing and are there trends that will encourage people to buy more of what you are selling?</p>



<p>Opportunities</p>



<p>What good opportunities can you spot?</p>



<p>What interesting trends are you aware of?</p>



<p>Does anyone on the team have a talent or connection you can utilize?</p>



<p>Is there a high-cost opportunity that would require a loan or outside funding to achieve?</p>



<p>Are there changes in technology and markets you can leverage?</p>



<p>Are there changes in social patterns, population profiles, lifestyle changes?</p>



<p>Are there upcoming events that your company may be able to take advantage of to grow the business?</p>



<p>Are there changes to regulations that might impact your company positively?</p>



<p>Threats</p>



<p>What obstacles do you face?</p>



<p>What are your competitors doing?</p>



<p>Are more competitors entering the market?</p>



<p>Are quality standards or specifications for your job, products or services changing?</p>



<p>Is changing technology threatening your position?</p>



<p>Do you have bad debt or cash-flow problems?</p>



<p>Could any of your weaknesses seriously threaten your business?</p>



<p>Will suppliers always be able to supply the raw materials you need at the prices you need?</p>



<p>Is consumer behavior changing in a way that could negatively impact your business?</p>



<p>Are there market trends that could become a threat?</p>



<p>Hint: When looking at opportunities, look at your strengths and ask yourself whether these open up any opportunities. Alternatively, look at your weaknesses and ask yourself if eliminating them could open up any opportunities. When you find a threat or weakness that could have major repercussions, deal with it immediately or put a contingency plan in place. Ultimately, protecting from losses is more important than striving for growth when thinking short term.</p>

<p>For the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic</p>



<p>With the global spread of the new coronavirus, COVID-19, many small business owners and managers are wondering what they can do to keep their employees, clients, and themselves safe from infection. Though there is still a lot of uncertainty involving COVID-19 and a lot more research needs to be done on the virus, there are several sensible measures that small business owners can take to ensure the safety of their staff.</p>



<p>But first, let’s discuss what we’re dealing with here.</p>



<p>WHAT IS A CORONAVIRUS?</p>



<p>According to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses">World Health Organization</a>&nbsp;(WHO), coronaviruses are a family of viruses that often cause respiratory infections. These could be a simple cold or more serious diseases such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).</p>



<p>COVID-19 is the disease that is caused by this newest coronavirus discovered in Wuhan, China in December of 2019. It has now spread across the globe, infecting tens-of-thousands of people, although the exact numbers are unknown at this point.</p>



<p>What are the Symptoms of COVID-19?</p>



<p>The main symptoms of COVID-19 are</p>



<p>Fever Dry Cough Fatigue Aches &amp; Pains Congestion Runny Nose Sore Throat Diarrhea</p>



<p>For most people, these symptoms are mild and accelerate gradually, though it’s important to note that some people can be infected with the disease but never show symptoms or feel sick at all.</p>



<p>How Does the Virus Spread?</p>



<p>The virus spreads from people who are infected to people who aren’t through respiratory droplets. That is mouth or nose droplets that are expelled when a person coughs, exhales, or sneezes.</p>



<p>You do not have to be in direct contact with someone in order to contract the virus. If you come into contact with an infected person’s respiratory droplets that are expelled on a surface or common object–handle, table, computer, etc.–then it’s possible for you to contract the virus as well. The most common way for someone to contract the virus in this way is if they touch the respiratory droplets of an infected person and then touch their nose, mouth, or eyes.</p>



<p>How You Should Prepare Your Business for COVID-19</p>



<p>To combat this virus and make sure that employees and clients are safe, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html">CDC encourages</a>&nbsp;employers to institute the following best practices:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Actively encourage sick employees to stay home</strong>&nbsp;– Employees with acute respiratory illnesses should stay home until their symptoms have disappeared for at least 24 hours and they no longer have a fever. Be flexible with your illness policies and allow sick employees to work from home if possible.</li>



<li><strong>Separate sick employees</strong>&nbsp;– Employees who exhibit symptoms should be separated from the rest of the employees and sent home immediately. It’s a good idea to keep all workers at least 3 feet away from each other at all times if possible.</li>



<li><strong>Emphasize respiratory etiquette and hand hygiene by all employees</strong>&nbsp;– All employees should cover their mouths and noses with tissues or their elbows when they cough or sneeze at work. Post signs that encourage employees to use best practices and stay home if exhibiting symptoms. Provide your staff with plenty of soap and hand sanitizer that contains at least 60-95% alcohol. Encourage employees to wash their hands for at least 20 seconds multiple times a day.</li>



<li><strong>Perform routine environmental cleaning</strong>&nbsp;– Clean surfaces that are touched frequently with disinfectants. These could be handles, doorknobs, keyboards, remote controls, work surfaces, etc. Make sure to provide plenty of disinfectant wipes around your workspaces for this purpose.</li>
</ul>

<p>Kids and teens aren’t the only ones with back to school needs, business owners are searching for back to school business funding, too.</p>



<p>Back to school business funding is a loose term that refers to the end of summer needs that business owners have. Seasonal business owners often find, depending on the industry, that their needs for business funding fall either at the start of the summer season or the start of the holiday season.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Non-seasonal businesses often experience end of summer demand spikes that require back to school business funding.&nbsp;</p>



<p>WHY BUSINESSES NEED BACK TO SCHOOL BUSINESS FUNDING</p>



<p>The need for back to school business funding arises for the same reason there is a summer slump that slows down sales. People are returning from vacations and getting back into their normal lives, hiring picks up again, and the ripple effect created from regular back to school shopping reaches into many industries.</p>



<p>Back to school shopping for elementary school, middle school, high school, and college highly impacts the retail industry, which often has slow sales in the summer when less people are at malls. The retail industry effects manufacturing, marketing, transportation, food and beverage, finance, and more.</p>



<p>Overall, companies are settling back into normal business operations as sales increase and employees are returning from vacations.</p>



<p>What it’s used for</p>



<p>Back to school business funding is used for a variety of assets depending on the industry. Since retail is the biggest industry affected, a boost in working capital is primarily used for:</p>



<p>Inventory Marketing Staff needs and payroll Starting new projects And more!</p>



<p>The early fall is also the time when businesses would start any other projects they need to have done before the holiday rush ties up all free time and cash flow. If a project isn’t done by late October, with or without funding, cash flow could be strained for the holiday season which could result in a major loss in profit.&nbsp;</p>
