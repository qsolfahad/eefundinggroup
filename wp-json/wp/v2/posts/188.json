Among firms with gross receipts under $500,000, loan denial rates for minority firms were at 42% compared to those of non-minority-owned firms at 16%. For high sales firms, the rate of loan denial was almost twice as high for minority firms as for non-minority firms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The study also found minority-owned firms are more likely to not apply for loans due to rejection fears. Among firms with gross receipts under $500,000, 33% of minority firms did not apply for loans because of fear of rejection compared to 17% of non-minority firms. For high sales firms, 19%of minority firms did not apply for loans because of a fear of rejection compared to 12% of non-minority firms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>WHAT CAUSES THIS DISPARITY?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Much of it comes down to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/forbesfinancecouncil\/2018\/01\/22\/why-minorities-have-so-much-trouble-accessing-small-business-loans\/#4f3b14ec55c4\">bank qualifications<\/a>. Banks require large amounts of collateral, high credit scores and strong revenue, which can be hard to obtain depending on your socioeconomic standing. Despite small business being a vital part of the economy of diverse communities, banks do not commonly give out loans to these minority-owned businesses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Minority Business Statistics<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>\u201cBetween 2007 and 2017 the number minority owned SMBs have grown by 79% reaching 11.1 million. This growth is about 10 times faster than the 7.6% overall growth rate for U.S. small businesses during this period.\u201d&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.smallbizlabs.com\/2017\/10\/number-of-minority-owned-us-small-businesses-growing-rapidly.html\">source<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\u201cThe populations of five states, including the two largest, California and Texas, are now over 50%&nbsp;<strong>minorities<\/strong>. Many other states, counties, and cities are approaching this threshold, thus understanding minority business ownership is increasingly important.\u201d&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/advocacy\/Minority-Owned-Businesses-in-the-US.pdf\">source<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\u201cIn 2012, 8.0 million minority-owned businesses contributed $1.38 trillion in revenue and 7.2 million jobs to the economy.\u201d&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/advocacy\/Minority-Owned-Businesses-in-the-US.pdf\">source<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\u201cMinority firms are less likely to be in the top 20 employment industries. Minority-owned businesses make up only 16.8% of businesses in these industries, far less than the 29% average across all industries.\u201d&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/advocacy\/Minority-Owned-Businesses-in-the-US.pdf\">source<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>What if minorities are rejected for a bank loan?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The alternative lending industry has been extremely beneficial in helping minorities get the funding they need to run and grow their businesses. While rates are typically higher than a traditional bank loan, merchants with low credit scores, seasonal cash flow, unique industries, no collateral and other former setbacks are able to get short term funding previously unavailable to them.
